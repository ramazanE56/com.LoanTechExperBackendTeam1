  Scenario: TC01: When a valid GET request is sent to the 'user/list/loan'
      endpoint with the appropriate authorization credentials, it should return
      a status code of 200, and the request remark should be "success"

    * The API user sets "user/list/loan" path parameters
    * The API user saves the response from the user list loan endpoint with valid authorization information
    * The API user verifies that the status code is 200
    * The API user verifies that the remark information in the response body is "success"

  Scenario: TC02: Verify that when a GET request is sent to the 'user/list/loan'
    endpoint with invalid authorization information, the returned status code is 401, and the error message in the request body is "Unauthorized request"
    Given The API user sets "user/list/loan" path parameters
    Then The API user records the response with invalid authorization information, verifies that the status code is '401' and confirms that the error information is Unauthorized
    #Api kullanicisi responsei ge√ßersiz authorization bilgisi ile kaydeder, status codeun 401 ve error bilgisinin Unauthorized oldugunu dogrular
