Feature: US003 :As a user, I want to be able to create a new user ticket record through API connection.
@abc
  Scenario: TC001: When a POST request with valid authorization information and correct data (subject, priority, message)
  is sent to the user/ticket/add endpoint, the returned status code should be 200, and the message in the response
  body should be verified as "Ticket opened successfully!"

    Given The API user sets "user/ticket/add" path parameters
    And   The API user prepares a POST request containing the correct data to send to the user ticket add endpoint
    When  The API user sends a POST request and saves the response from the user ticket add endpoint with valid authorization information
    Then  The API user verifies that the status code is 200
    And   The API user verifies that the message information in the response body is "Ticket opened successfully!"


  Scenario: TC002: When a POST request with valid authorization information and no data (subject, priority, message)
  is sent to the user/ticket/add endpoint, the returned status code should be 203, and the remark in the response
  body should be verified as "failed"

    Given The API user sets "user/ticket/add" path parameters
    And   The API user prepares a POST request without data to send to the user ticket add endpoint
    When  The API user sends a POST request and saves the response from the user ticket add endpoint with valid authorization information
    Then  The API user verifies that the status code is 203
    And   The API user verifies that the remark information in the response body is "failed"


  Scenario: TC003: When a POST request with valid authorization information and incomplete missing data
  (priority,message) is sent to the user/ticket/add endpoint, the returned status code should be 203,
  and the remark in the response body should be verified as "failed"

    Given The API user sets "user/ticket/add" path parameters
    And   The API user prepares a POST request with missing data to send to the user ticket add endpoint.
    When  The API user sends a POST request and saves the response from the user ticket add endpoint with valid authorization information
    Then  The API user verifies that the status code is 203
    And   The API user verifies that the remark information in the response body is "failed"

  Scenario: TC004: Verify that when a POST request with invalid authorization information and correct data
  (subject, priority, message) is sent to the 'user/ticket/add' endpoint, the returned status code is 401,
  and the error message in the response body is "Unauthorized request"

    Given The API user sets "user/ticket/add" path parameters
    And   The API user prepares a POST request containing the correct data to send to the user ticket add endpoint
    When  The API user sends a POST request and saves the response from the user ticket add endpoint with invalid authorization information
    Then  The API user verifies that the status code is 401
    And   The API user verifies that the error information in the response body is "Unauthorized request"


  Scenario Outline: TC005: The creation of a new ticket record intended to be generated through the API should be
  verified. This can be confirmed by sending a GET request to the 'user/ticket/detail/{{id}}' endpoint with
  the Opened ticked id returned in the response body, thus validating that the record has been created

    Given The API user sets "user/ticket/detail/<id>" path parameters
    And   The API user saves the response from the user ticket detail endpoint with valid authorization information
    Then  The API user verifies that the status code is 200
    And   The API user verifies that the success attribute in the response body is true
    Then  The API user verifies that the id information in the response body is <valueId>

    Examples:
      | id  | valueId |
      | 180 | 180    |
